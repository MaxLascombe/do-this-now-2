# Agent Prompt

Copy and paste the following prompt to start a new agent session:

---

Read `CURRENT_STATE.md` to understand the current architecture and what already exists. Read `TASKS.md` for the list of pending tasks. Tasks have no inherent order—pick the single most important one to work on based on dependencies and priority, regardless of where it appears in the list. Complete that task, then: remove it from `TASKS.md`, and update `CURRENT_STATE.md` to document what was built (in the same style: describe the current state of the code, not a checklist). Provide a short, one-line commit message for the user to use.
